## Test Application
This test application was built with Angular 6, Angular Material, ServiceWorker and Bootstrap. The main purpose for this app is to illustrate how a Progressive Web App can be built with Angular by using the ServiceWorker module. Therefor, a limited use case has been implemented which is just to add documents to the local storage and to load the content from the RIS (Rechtsinformationssystem Ã–sterreich), when network is available. However, the CORS issue has not been addressed for this development so you will encounter an error when you start the app locally or with https://spielwiese.jusline.at. In order to use the app you need to install https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi and turn it on in order to switch of CORS in your chrome browser.
